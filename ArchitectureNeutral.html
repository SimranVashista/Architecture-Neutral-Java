<h2>Basis of Java creation </h2>
1) Interestingly, Java was not build for Internet.It was created for the prime need of developing a programming which will be independent of the platform that could build small embedded system that can be embedded in the circuits for efficient and effective functioning of machines such as for washing machine, air conditioner, refrigerator etc.
<br>
2) Java's core concept object oriented feature was derived from C++.
<br>
<br>
<h2>How Java changed the internet</h2>
1) Java when came into existence was only be seen as per one prospective that is for circuit and system.
<br>
2) But,during this period WWW(World Wide Web) was also a concept flourishing over the world to the Green Team decided to test the concept of Java over internet and it worked.
<br>
3) Earlier World Wide Web(WWW) was only having information part of text and still picture .But because of Java there were new scenario introduce that is "graphics".

4) Also there were more concepts too in making the Java the heart of internet :-
<br>
a) Java Applet:-Applet are intended to be small program that are designed to be small program that are designed to be transmitted over internet and automatically executed by a Java -compatible web browser only.
<br>
b) Java security:-This is the prime concerned aspect of Java that provides you with immense security over web and to all standalone program.It is served through the concept of Object Oriented Programming in Java(Encapsulation,Abstraction,Inheritance, Polymorphism).
<br>
c) Java Portability:- Portability is the power of transferring files over the internet this is very important because there are many different type of computer and operating system connected to it then we need virtually any computer connected to the internet.
<br>
